# Moment of Force Physics Simulator

An interactive web application for understanding the concept of moment of force (torque) in physics. This website features a 3D simulator, educational videos, and visual diagrams to help students grasp the fundamental principles of torque.

## Features

- Interactive 3D simulator using Three.js
- Real-time torque calculation
- Educational videos from Google Drive
- Visual diagrams and explanations
- Responsive design for all devices

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the files
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. No additional setup or installation required

## Using the Simulator

The simulator allows you to experiment with different parameters:

- Force (N): Adjust the magnitude of the applied force
- Distance (m): Change the length of the lever arm
- Angle (degrees): Modify the angle between the force and lever arm

The torque is calculated and displayed in real-time using the formula:
τ = r × F = rF sin(θ)

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Three.js for 3D visualization
- Google Drive API for video integration

## Browser Compatibility

The website works best in modern browsers that support WebGL:
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- Safari
